Skinning
========

To make it easy to adjust the gameplay screen's appearance,
the *skin* is not built into the game's source code.

.. contents::

Location
--------

The skin is located at the :tree:`public/skins/default` folder.
Inside, you will see several files.

`skin.xml`
  This is the skin file that will be loaded by Bemuse.
  **Do not edit this file,**
  since this file has been generated from the skin template.

`skin_template.jade`
  This is the skin template that is used to generate `skin.xml`.
  It is written in Jade_ language.

`skin_data.yml`
  A YAML file describing global variables available to the skin template.

`gulpfile.js`
  A Gulp script to compile the template into `skin.xml`.

`*/*.png`
  Image assets.

.. _Jade: http://jade-lang.com/


Skin Development
----------------

Make sure you have already set up the project and started the local development server.

Install Gulp globally, so that you can invoke it directly from the command line::

  npm install -g gulp

In another terminal window, :command:`cd` to the skin's directory::

  cd public/skins/default

Then run Gulp::

  gulp

This will compile the skin into `skin.xml`.
If you change `skin_template.jade` or `skin_data.yml`, the skin is recompiled.
Now, you can refresh the browser to see the changes.
